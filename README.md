<h2 align="center">Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sohab</h2>


  ```cpp
  class Sohab {
        private:
          int age = 21;
          string school = "Dalhousie University";
          string[] courses = new string[] {"Data Structures, Operating Systems, Databases, Robotics, Web Dev"};
          string[] hobbies = new string[] {"Football", "Hiking", "Piano"};
        public:
          Sohab();
  }
  ```

Here are a few things I'm doing right now...
